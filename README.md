# cmus-remote
Custom Cmus Remote for Unified Remote.

Very Basic but sufficient controls.Works without running cmus via server.

Will use cmus-remote commands for functionality

Use [detachable cmus](https://github.com/cmus/cmus/wiki/detachable-cmus) for detaching cmus from terminal.

- Unified Remote needs to be installed on both Server and Phone.
- Copy this files to custom remotes directory on the server.Now you can see the remote on your phone.
- Run cmus via detachable cmus so that it connects with remote and you can control it with remote.
